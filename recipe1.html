      <h1 class="roboto-slab">Typical filipino breakfast recipe</h1>
      <p>
        The meal starts with a serving of steamed rice, which is a staple in
        Filipino cuisine. The rice provides a filling and satisfying base for
        the other components. Next comes the longanisa, which is commonly
        pan-fried until it becomes slightly crispy on the outside while
        retaining its juicy and flavorful interior. Longanisa can vary in taste
        and style depending on the region, with some versions being sweeter or
        spicier than others. Finally, a sunny-side-up or scrambled egg completes
        the breakfast ensemble. The eggs are typically cooked to perfection,
        with a runny yolk that mixes wonderfully with the rice, adding a rich
        and creamy element to the dish. This classic Filipino breakfast of eggs,
        rice, and longanisa combines the protein from the sausage and eggs with
        the energy-providing carbohydrates from the rice, making it a satisfying
        and hearty way to start the day. It's a beloved breakfast choice for
        many Filipinos, showcasing the country's diverse and flavorful culinary
        traditions.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        4 cups cooked rice 8 longanisa sausages 4 eggs Cooking oil Instructions:
        Cook the longanisa: In a large skillet or frying pan, heat a small
        amount of cooking oil over medium heat. Add the longanisa sausages and
        cook them until they are browned and cooked through, about 10-12
        minutes. Make sure to turn them occasionally for even cooking. Prepare
        the eggs: In a separate non-stick pan, heat a small amount of cooking
        oil over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the pan and cook them
        according to your preference (sunny-side-up, scrambled, or however you
        like them). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Warm up the rice: If
        you don't have freshly cooked rice, you can reheat cooked rice in a
        microwave or by steaming it. Assemble the dish: Place a serving of warm
        rice on a plate. Add the cooked longanisa sausages alongside the rice.
        Top it off with the cooked eggs. Serve and enjoy: The Filipino breakfast
        of eggs, rice, and longanisa is typically enjoyed with a side of vinegar
        or soy sauce for dipping. You can also add some sliced tomatoes or
        cucumber for a refreshing touch. Serve the dish hot and savor the
        delicious combination of flavors and textures. Note: Longanisa sausages
        can be found in Filipino or Asian grocery stores. If you can't find
        them, you can substitute with other sausage varieties, such as sweet
        Italian sausages or chorizo, for a different flavor profile.
